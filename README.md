# Predicting Secondary School Student Performance: Replication and Improvement of Existing Research Results
This project is a comprehensive replication and extension of the 2008 paper by P. Cortez and A. Silva, "Using Data Mining to Predict Secondary School Student Performance".

The analysis was conducted in R and is divided into two main phases:

1. A faithful replication of the original study's results.
2. An extension that implements a systematic feature selection process to build simpler, more powerful predictive models.

The full analysis and findings are detailed in the accompanying Final Report.
